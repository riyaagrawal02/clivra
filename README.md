## 🔍 Why Clivra Exists

Most students don’t fail because they don’t work hard.
They fail because they **don’t know what to work on today**.

Common problems:

* Static timetables that don’t adapt
* Poor revision prioritization
* False confidence before exams
* Burnout from unrealistic schedules

👉 **Clivra solves the decision layer**, not just task tracking.

## 🧠 What Makes Clivra Different

| Typical Study Apps   | Clivra                             |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Manual schedules     | Auto-generated, adaptive schedules |
| To-do lists          | Priority-driven execution plan     |
| Streak-only tracking | Progress + confidence feedback     |


Clivra answers one core question clearly:

> **“Why am I studying this topic today?”**

## 🧩 Core Features (System-Oriented)

### 🧮 Priority Scoring Engine

Each topic is assigned a **priority score (0–100)** using:

* Subject strength (weak → strong)
* Confidence level (1–5)
* Days remaining until exam
* Last revision timestamp

This ensures:

* Weak topics surface early
* Strong topics are revised, not ignored
* Urgency increases naturally as exams approach

---

### 📅 Adaptive Daily Schedule Generator

* Builds a **realistic day plan** based on available hours
* Uses Pomodoro blocks (configurable)
* Mixes:

  * New learning
  * Active revision
  * Short recall sessions
* Rebalances automatically if a day is missed
  *(no overload, no guilt loops)*


---

### 📊 Progress & Exam Readiness

**Weekly Report**

* Planned vs completed time
* Subject-wise effort distribution
* Confidence trend
* Missed vs recovered sessions

**Exam Readiness Prediction**
Calculated using:

* Topic completion %
* Revision frequency
* Consistency score
* Confidence movement

Status levels:
